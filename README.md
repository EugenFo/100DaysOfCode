## Goals

My major goal is to learn Go/Golang.

I also have a few projects in mind, which I want to do. For example a URL shortener written in Go and much more. But at first the basics!

## Logs

The logs are stored in the log.md.

This repository will only contain the log and a few exercises. Real Go projects will have there own repository, but they will be linked.

I'm quite excited about this Challenge! :)
