# 100DaysOfCode - Log

## Day 1: January 3, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Started to learn the basics of Golang with the [Tour of Golang](https://tour.golang.org). Functions, declaration and scope of variables, type inference, type conversion and a bit about Printf() function.

**Thoughts**: A lot of the basics aren't new to me. Syntax is diffrent, but I'm getting used to it.

## Day 2: January 4, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Basics day Nr. 2. Learend the loops, statements and a bit pointers.

**Thoughts**: It's interesting that Go has "only" the for loop. Switch case statements, well the only thing that is new for me is that you don't need to put a break in every case. Defer keyword is really new to me and it's quite weird, but I see the power of it. Tomorrow I have to look up panic, recover and a deeper dive into defer.

## Day 3: January 5, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Deeper look into defer, panic and recover. Understood that it is very useful, when it comes to error handeling. Pointers. Pointers everywhere. And a tiny bit of struct

**Thoughts**: Learned that pointers are not difficult, but I need a better understanding, when to use them. Learned that Go has no classes, but struct instead.

## Day 4: January 6, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Arrays, slices, make and maps. Still learning with Tour of Go.

**Thoughts**: Everyday a bit of progress. Need still to learn a lot.

---

## Day 5: January 7, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Learned about methods, value and pointer receivers, value and pointer arguments.

**Thoughts**: Methods in Go works a bit diffrent than in other OOP Languages, because Go has no classes.

## Day 6: January 8, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Only interfaces today.

**Thoughts**: It's difficult to understand the concept of interfaces in Go. Maybe because I never worked with interfaces before. I get kinda the idea behind it, but I definitly need more practice with interfaces.

---

## Day 7: January 9, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Again Interfaces

**Thoughts**: Got a better understanding when and why to use interfaces. The best way to practice such things is if you use them in real projects, I guess.

## Day 8: January 10, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Goroutines and a bit of Channels and Closures

**Thoughts**: Really interessting how goroutines work and how you can speed up your Go program. [Really good Goroutine Article](https://medium.com/@vigneshsk/how-to-write-high-performance-code-in-golang-using-go-routines-227edf979c3c)

---

## Day 9: January 11, 2019

**Today's Progress**: unbuffered and buffered channels, how channels create a Deadlock and how to avoid this

**Thoughts**: Goroutines and channels just belong together. And that's not that difficult to understand.

## Day 10: January 12, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Did not much Progress today. Just implemented bubblesort in Go.

**Thoughts**: I already implemented a bubblesort algorithm in JavaScript. So I just translated it into Go.

---

## Day 11: January 13, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Theory of mergesort and started to implement it.

**Thoughts**: Theory is quite simple, but implementation is not so simple.

---

## Day 12: January 14, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Worked again at mergesort

**Thoughts**: The algorithm can cut the slice into multiple halves, but it can't put them together into the right order...

---

## Day 13: January 15, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Finished merge sort and learned a bit about the workspace and package management in golang.

**Thoughts**: My Problem with merge sort was that I didn't really passed the write variable from one function to another, because my return was wrong. It was only this bug. But I'm still not quite sure when and where to use the return function.

## Day 14: January 16, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Since I'm not at my normal dev environment I learned a bit about encoding and decoding of JSON in the golang playground

**Thoughts**: At the beginning it was difficult to understand how this works in Go. But the more I work with it the better I understood it.

---

## Day 15: January 17, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Day number 2 that I'm not at my normal dev environment. Learned a bit more on maps and sort()

**Thoughts**: Still learning the basic stuff, but soon I need to work on a real project. But before that I have to learn something about creating a webserver in Go.

---

## Day 16: January 18, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Started to learn about creating a web server with Go.

**Thoughts**: The basic things aren't new to me since I already created simple webservers with Node.js and the Flask library in Python. But still in Go it's diffrent.

---

## Day 17: January 19, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Again net/http library in Go.

**Thoughts**: Worked with [this good article](https://golang.org/doc/articles/wiki/). Learned a lot about error handling, write and read files and redirect.
