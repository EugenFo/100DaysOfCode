# 100DaysOfCode - Log

## Day 1: January 3, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Started to learn the basics of Golang with the [Tour of Golang](https://tour.golang.org). Functions, declaration and scope of variables, type inference, type conversion and a bit about Printf() function.

**Thoughts**: A lot of the basics aren't new to me. Syntax is diffrent, but I'm getting used to it.

## Day 2: January 4, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Basics day Nr. 2. Learend the loops, statements and a bit pointers.

**Thoughts**: It's interesting that Go has "only" the for loop. Switch case statements, well the only thing that is new for me is that you don't need to put a break in every case. Defer keyword is really new to me and it's quite weird, but I see the power of it. Tomorrow I have to look up panic, recover and a deeper dive into defer.

## Day 3: January 5, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Deeper look into defer, panic and recover. Understood that it is very useful, when it comes to error handeling. Pointers. Pointers everywhere. And a tiny bit of struct

**Thoughts**: Learned that pointers are not difficult, but I need a better understanding, when to use them. Learned that Go has no classes, but struct instead.

## Day 4: January 6, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Arrays, slices, make and maps. Still learning with Tour of Go.

**Thoughts**: Everyday a bit of progress. Need still to learn a lot.

---

## Day 5: January 7, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Learned about methods, value and pointer receivers, value and pointer arguments.

**Thoughts**: Methods in Go works a bit diffrent than in other OOP Languages, because Go has no classes.

---

## Day 6: January 8, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Only interfaces today.

**Thoughts**: It's difficult to understand the concept of interfaces in Go. Maybe because I never worked with interfaces before. I get kinda the idea behind it, but I definitly need more practice with interfaces.

---

## Day 7: January 9, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Again Interfaces

**Thoughts**: Got a better understanding when and why to use interfaces. The best way to practice such things is if you use them in real projects, I guess.

## Day 8: January 10, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Goroutines and a bit of Channels and Closures

**Thoughts**: Really interessting how goroutines work and how you can speed up your Go program. [Really good Goroutine Article](https://medium.com/@vigneshsk/how-to-write-high-performance-code-in-golang-using-go-routines-227edf979c3c)

---

## Day 9: January 11, 2019

**Today's Progress**: unbuffered and buffered channels, how channels create a Deadlock and how to avoid this

**Thoughts**: Goroutines and channels just belong together. And that's not that difficult to understand.

---

## Day 10: January 12, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Did not much Progress today. Just implemented bubblesort in Go.

**Thoughts**: I already implemented a bubblesort algorithm in JavaScript. So I just translated it into Go.

**Link to Work**: [Day 10](https://github.com/EugenFo/100DaysOfCode/tree/master/day010 "Day10")

---

## Day 11: January 13, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Theory of mergesort and started to implement it.

**Thoughts**: Theory is quite simple, but implementation is not so simple.

**Link to Work**: [Day 11](https://github.com/EugenFo/100DaysOfCode/tree/master/day011-012 "Day11")

---

## Day 12: January 14, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Worked again at mergesort

**Thoughts**: The algorithm can cut the slice into multiple halves, but it can't put them together into the right order...

**Link to Work**: [Day 12](https://github.com/EugenFo/100DaysOfCode/tree/master/day011-012 "Day12")

---

## Day 13: January 15, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Finished merge sort and learned a bit about the workspace and package management in golang.

**Thoughts**: My Problem with merge sort was that I didn't really passed the write variable from one function to another, because my return was wrong. It was only this bug. But I'm still not quite sure when and where to use the return function.

---

## Day 14: January 16, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Since I'm not at my normal dev environment I learned a bit about encoding and decoding of JSON in the golang playground

**Thoughts**: At the beginning it was difficult to understand how this works in Go. But the more I work with it the better I understood it.

**Link to Work**: [Day 14](https://github.com/EugenFo/100DaysOfCode/tree/master/day014 "Day14")

---

## Day 15: January 17, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Day number 2 that I'm not at my normal dev environment. Learned a bit more on maps and sort()

**Thoughts**: Still learning the basic stuff, but soon I need to work on a real project. But before that I have to learn something about creating a webserver in Go.

**Link to Work**: [Day 15](https://github.com/EugenFo/100DaysOfCode/tree/master/day015 "Day15")

---

## Day 16: January 18, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Started to learn about creating a web server with Go.

**Thoughts**: The basic things aren't new to me since I already created simple webservers with Node.js and the Flask library in Python. But still in Go it's diffrent.

**Link to Work**: [Day 16](https://github.com/EugenFo/100DaysOfCode/tree/master/day016 "Day16")

---

## Day 17: January 19, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Again net/http library in Go.

**Thoughts**: Worked with [this good article](https://golang.org/doc/articles/wiki/). Learned a lot about error handling, write and read files and redirect.  

**Link to Work**: [Day 17](https://github.com/EugenFo/100DaysOfCode/tree/master/day017 "Day17")

---

## Day 18: January 21, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Mutual exclusion aka mutex.

**Thoughts**: Should have learned it earlier, when I dealt with goroutines and channels. Oh and I skipped yesterday...

**Link to Work**: [Day 18](https://github.com/EugenFo/100DaysOfCode/tree/master/day018 "Day18")

---

## Day 19: January 22, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Did 2 easy Challenges from [Daily Programmer](https://reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer)

**Thoughts**: Those challenges were not that difficult. In the first challenge I struggled a bit to get the string into a slice, since I didn't found any library for this. Challenge #2 was also easy.

---

## Day 20: January 23, 2019

**Today's Progress**: 1 challenge again from [Daily Programmer](https://reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer), but I'm not finished yet...

**Thoughts**: I really struggle with sorting a map by value...

**Link to Work**: [Day 20](https://github.com/EugenFo/100DaysOfCode/tree/master/day020-021 "Day20")

---

## Day 21: January 24, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Fixed the problem with the sorting of a map by its values.

**Thoughts**: In fact, I used a workaround by creating a struct and copying the keys and values of the map into the struct. Did not much today, just this fix.

---

## Day 22: January 25, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Today I used the AWS SDK for Go and created a bucket, list all Items of a bucket, uploaded and downloaded an item from and to a bucket.

**Thoughts**: It is really cool to use the SDK from AWS to handle all the API requests via Go. And that's easy to understand.

---

## Day 23: January 27, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Skipped last day, but did some Theory on how my URL shortener app should work. Today I learned CRUD operations in Go with the mux package.

**Thoughts**: Just leanered a bit RESTApi operations in go. Watched the [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SonwZ6MF5BE) from Brad Traversy. Really good introduction in mux.

**Link to Work**: [Day 23](https://github.com/EugenFo/100DaysOfCode/tree/master/day023 "Day23")

---

## Day 24: January 28, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Started to code my url-shortener website. Did some basic RESTApi stuff, what I learned yesterday.

**Thoughts**: I'm thinking about on what and how to implement things. That's why I already have lot of comments. Also I'm not working directly on the master branch(which don't exists yet).

---

## Day 25: January 29, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Worked today on the save Function

**Thoughts**: Need to evaluate which hash or encoder to use. With SHA256 or base64 the short Url would be... well not short. Maybe SHA1?

**Link to Work**: [url-shortener-go](https://github.com/EugenFo/url-shortener-go)

---

## Day 26: January 30, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Make a lot of progress for the save Function.

**Thoughts**: I decided to use the unix timestamp and SHA1 for hashing even if it's not the appropriate way. Need to change it later. It would cost much more time to code it. At the moment I just need a function that saves some data, so I now, that the base function works!

---

## Day 27: January 31, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the redirectFunction

**Thoughts**: 2 Problem here. 1. I can't really select an value in a slice like in a map. 2. the redirect function is not working like it should be. So I really need to implement mongoDB soon.

---

## Day 28: Februray 2, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Finally I managed to redirect to another page.

**Thoughts**: Problem was, that I just typed something like "www.google.com". The Redirect function thought that it's something that is redirected internally, not to another page. Solution was to add the http protocol...
Next step is to deal with MongoDB!
