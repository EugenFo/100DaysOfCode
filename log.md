# 100DaysOfCode - Log

## Day 1: January 3, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Started to learn the basics of Golang with the [Tour of Golang](https://tour.golang.org). Functions, declaration and scope of variables, type inference, type conversion and a bit about Printf() function.

**Thoughts**: A lot of the basics aren't new to me. Syntax is diffrent, but I'm getting used to it.

## Day 2: January 4, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Basics day Nr. 2. Learend the loops, statements and a bit pointers.

**Thoughts**: It's interesting that Go has "only" the for loop. Switch case statements, well the only thing that is new for me is that you don't need to put a break in every case. Defer keyword is really new to me and it's quite weird, but I see the power of it. Tomorrow I have to look up panic, recover and a deeper dive into defer.

## Day 3: January 5, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Deeper look into defer, panic and recover. Understood that it is very useful, when it comes to error handeling. Pointers. Pointers everywhere. And a tiny bit of struct

**Thoughts**: Learned that pointers are not difficult, but I need a better understanding, when to use them. Learned that Go has no classes, but struct instead.
